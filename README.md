# MINI-PROJECT
Relationship to IoT Concepts
Microcontrollers (from your IoT discussion):

Tools like Git and VS Code are used to write/test firmware for IoT microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32).

VirtualBox allows emulating IoT hardware environments during development.

Sensors & Actuators:

AWS/GitHub accounts (mentioned in your guide) store data from IoT sensors and trigger actuator commands via cloud platforms.

Example: Soil moisture sensor (IoT) → AWS cloud → Activates irrigation actuator.

Infrastructure:
DevOps tools automate deployment of IoT systems (e.g., pushing firmware updates to 10,000 devices).

Key Elements in Your Guide
Component	Purpose in DevOps/IoT
Git	Version control for IoT device firmware/scripts.
VS Code	IDE for coding microcontrollers and IoT cloud functions.
VirtualBox	Simulates IoT edge devices for testing before physical deployment.
AWS Account	Cloud platform for processing sensor data, managing IoT devices (AWS IoT Core).
GitHub Account	Hosts repositories for IoT projects and CI/CD pipelines.
Next Steps for Your DevOps Setup
Install Tools:

Git | VS Code | VirtualBox

Create Accounts:

AWS | GitHub

IoT Integration Example:

python
# Sample IoT sensor data handler (VS Code + AWS IoT)
import boto3
client = boto3.client('iot-data', region_name='us-east-1')
response = client.publish(
    topic='sensors/temperature',
    qos=1,
    payload='{"device_id": "sensor123", "temp": 28.5}'
)
